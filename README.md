# Rockbuster_SQL
Rockbuster  Stealth  LLC  is  a  movie  rental  company  that  used  to  have  stores  around  the   
world.   Facing  stiff  competition  from  streaming  services  such  as  Netflix  and  Amazon  Prime,   
the  Rockbuster  Stealth  management  team  is  planning  to  use  its  existing  movie  licenses  to   
launch  an  online  video  rental  service  in  order  to  stay  competitive. 
# Objective
Our collaboration with Rockbusters Business Intelligence team will assist in the launch of the new online service's strategy. The dataset provided is composed of a relational database containing details about the current clients.
# Key questions
● Which  movies  contributed  the  most/least  to  revenue  gain?     
● What  was  the  average  rental  duration  for  all  videos?   
● Which  countries  are  Rockbuster  customers  based  in?   
● Where  are  customers  with  a  high  lifetime  value  based?   
● Do  sales  figures  vary  between  geographic  regions?
